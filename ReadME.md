# An Implementation of Neural Network in CUDA C++

This is basic implementation of Neural Networks in CUDA to learn how GPU accelerate Massive Matrix Multiplication required by these Neural Networks to work.

* The Current work just runs a basic fully connected Network in forward and backward propagation more works needs to be done to handle convolution and other filters.

* This is not optimized to run NN faster this is meant to look at the processing happening inside a GPU.
